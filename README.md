CEN 3024C - 14877 Software Development 1
Program Objective: I am tasked with creating a software system to use in a local library.
They need to be able to add, remove, and display patrons to/from the program.
Using my software development plan I created to help guide me in my
coding process. This program utilizes the concepts from my COP 3330C
 Object-Oriented Programming class in a scenario real-world application.
